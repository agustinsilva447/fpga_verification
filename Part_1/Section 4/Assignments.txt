A51: Create a Class consisting of 3 data members each of unsigned integer type. Initialize them to 45,78, and 90. Use the display function to print the values on the console.

A52: Create a function that will perform the multiplication of the two unsigned integer variables. Compare values return by function with the expected result and if both values match send "Test Passed" to Console else send "Test Failed".

A53: Create a task that will generate stimulus for addr , wr, and en signal as mentioned in a waveform of the Instruction tab. Assume address is 6-bit wide while en and wr both are 1-bit wide. The stimulus should be sent on a positive edge of 25 MHz clock signal.

A54: Create a function that generate and return 32 values of multiple of 8 (0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 .... 248). Store this value in the local array of the testbench top and also print the value of each element of this array on the console.

A55: Assume the class consists of three 8-bit data members a, b, and c. Create a Custom Constructor that allows the user to update the value of these data members while adding a constructor to the class. Test your code by adding the value of 2, 4, and 56 to a, b and c respectively. 

A56: Assume class consists of three data members a, b, and c each of size 4-bit. Create a task inside the class that returns the result of the addition of data members. The task must also be capable of sending the value of a, b, c, and result to the console. Verify code for a = 1, b = 2, and c = 4.

A57: Create a deep copy of the Generator class. To verify the deep copy code assign value of the copy method to another instance of the generator class in TB top. Print the value of data members in the generator class as well as copied class. Refer Instruction tab for Generator class code.
