A21: Assume System Consist of two global signals resetn and clk. Use an initial block to initialize clk to 1'b0 and resetn to 1'b0. User must keep resetn in an active low state for 60 nSec at the start of the simulation and then make active high. Assume `timescale 1ns/1ps

A22: Assume `timescale 1ps/1ps. Generate a 25 MHz square wave waveform for the Signal clk.

A23: Write a code to generate a 9MHz square waveform for the signal sclk. Assume timescale with 1nsec time-unit and 3 digit precision.

A24: Write a function capable of generating a square waveform with the help of period(in nSec) and duty cycle(0 to 1). The phase difference is assumed to be 0 for the entire system operation. Verify function behavior by generating waveform for the signal clk with period: 40 nsec and duty cycle: 0.4
